# Gr-RMLHSR: Learning a Discriminative Grassmannian Neural Network for Visual Classification
## Contribution
>
• A Riemannian metric learning regularization module for improving the model capacity is proposed.<br />
• A hard sample reward strategy for refining the discriminability of the learning features is suggested.

## Usage
If you want to train and evaluate the original Grassmann network, please run demo.py.<br />
If you want to train and evaluate the Grassmann network with PM metric learning term, run demo_PM.py.<br />
If you want to train and evaluate the Grassmann network with PAM metric learning term, run demo_PAM.py.<br />
