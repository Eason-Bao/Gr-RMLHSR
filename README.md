# Gr-RMLHSR: Learning a Discriminative Grassmannian Neural Network for Visual Classification
## Contribution
>
• A Riemannian metric learning regularization module for improving the model capacity is proposed.<br />
• A hard sample reward strategy for refining the discriminability of the learning features is suggested.
